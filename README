INTRODUCTION
------------

Cushion is an adaptation layer for couchdb. It's in early stages of development,
more documentation will be added when it's more advanced.

BUILDING
--------

It is quite manual right now. I just set up an erlware project with lhttpc,
cushion, and cushion_tests in the lib dir and compile them.

In the future, I'll create a bootstraper to automate this process.

TESTING
-------

All tests are in the cushion_tests application.

INTERNAL DETAILS
----------------

The code is organised as follows:

  * The cushion_couch_api module contains raw calls to the couchdb API. There
    are not any inteligence here, most of the magic happens in lhttpc
    guts. Responses are unparsed binaries. This module is nice for low level
    couchdb testing when something goes wrong in other modules but is not
    intended for external use.
