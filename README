INTRODUCTION
------------

Cushion is an adaptation layer for couchdb. It's in early stages of development,
more documentation will be added when it's more advanced.

BUILDING
--------

It is quite manual right now. I just set up an erlware project with lhttpc,
cushion, and cushion_tests in the lib dir and compile them.

In the future, I'll create a bootstraper to automate this process.

TESTING
-------

All tests are in cushion_tests application.
